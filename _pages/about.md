I am a post-doctoral researcher at EPFL (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne), specializing in applying machine learning techniques to chemical engineering and bioinformatics. My research work bridges data analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning.

### Current Role:
Since 2022, I have been working as a postdoctoral researcher in chemistry and chemical engineering at EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland. My current focus is on engineering nano-bio optical sensors using machine learning techniques. I leverage Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Keras to develop neural network models (CNN, GNN, GCN) for predicting sensor responses.

### Past Experience:
Before my current role, I worked as a process engineer from 2016 to 2021 at Petropars Operation and Management Company and Artiman’s Process Development Engineering Company in Tehran, Iran, where I contributed to optimization projects using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

### Educational Background:
I earned my PhD in Chemical Engineering from the University of Tehran in 2022. My doctoral research involved developing machine learning models for predicting the optical response of DNA-based nanosensors. I have also completed a Ph.D. exchange program at EPFL, and I hold a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering, both with high academic distinction.

### Skills:
- **Programming:** Python (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), MATLAB
- **Engineering Software:** Aspen HYSYS, ANSYS Fluent, Gambit, LIGGGHTS, OpenFOAM, CFDEM
- **Specializations:** Machine learning, sensor response prediction, computational fluid dynamics, process optimization

### Selected Achievements:
- Supervised students across Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D. levels.
- Awarded full scholarships for BSc, MSc, and Ph.D. programs.
- First place in Iran's Nanotechnology Initiative Council's Leading Competition.
- Member of the National Elites Foundation (2016-2021).

### Patents and Publications:
- **Patent:** Sustainable Magnetorheological Fluid Synthesis with Proper Rheological Properties for industrial applications.
- **Book:** "Process Optimization in Chemical Engineering," published by Iran University of Science and Technology.
- **Journal Publications:** Authored several research papers on machine learning applications in nano-biosensor design and chemical engineering processes, with an h-index of 10 and over 300 citations.

### Interests:
Outside of work, I enjoy modeling and simulation, team-based projects, chess, ping-pong, hiking, and movies.
