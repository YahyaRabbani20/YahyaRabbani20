- 👋 Hi, I’m YahyaRabbani 
- 👀 I’m interested in applying **machine learning** in **chemical engineering**, **bioinformatics**, and developing **nano-biosensors**.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more advanced methods in **neural networks**, such as **NN**, **CNN**, **GNN**, and **GCN**, while applying these to **bioinformatics** (DNA sequencing) and sensor response prediction.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve **machine learning applications in chemical processes**, **nano-biosensors**, and **bioinformatics**.
